// 1v1 or 1vCPU , Different modes: 1 win / 3 out of 5 / 4 out of 7 , Single Page or Multiple page Application for Desktop, and Must have a way to show the rules of the game

// Peer Comment : The figma prototype looks similar to the website. The website is functioning. It satisfies the requirements such as having 1 v 1 and 1 v CPU, having different modes of best out of 1, best 3 out of 5, best 4 out of 7. The website was built on a single page with rules being a button function that pops up a message for the game rules. The illustration looks great, concise, and appealing. Good job!

Built out some of the basic html and css for the website and made some pages

I was working on it for a while but decided I wanted to try to make it a single page application so I restarted and worked on some the the js logic and got through most on it. I also worked on the 1vCPU and have most the design done. I also changed the design a little bit from the figma I like the new version a little better

I worked on the 1v1 mostly and fixed some problems with js mostly I also learned how to change the icon for the tab so now a picture displays.
