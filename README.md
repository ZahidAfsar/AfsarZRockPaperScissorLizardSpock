// Peer Comment : The figma prototype looks similar to the website. The website is functioning. It satisfies the requirements such as having 1 v 1 and 1 v CPU, having different modes of best out of 1, best 3 out of 5, best 4 out of 7. The website was built on a single page with rules being a button function that pops up a message for the game rules. The illustration looks great, concise, and appealing. Good job!
